Spider-Man Venom.
|This is everything I was told NOT to do.
|DON'T get into any kind of trouble.
|DON'T draw attention to yourself. And whatever you do...
|Don't bond with the symbiote.
|We should be running.

I know.
| They're after us. This is what he warned you about.

I KNOW.
|I can feel it... you want to stay and fight, but it won't bring him back.

Eddie's GONE, Dylan.
|And we should--

SHUT UP. SHUT UP. SHUT UP!
|Stop telling me what to do.
|"You're not my dad!"

[12 hours ago.]

12,000 Light-years away from earth. This is where it STARTS.

The NEW DEAL.

With four symbiotes drifting through the void. UNBONDED, waiting for a HOST -- like billions of their kin.
|From nearby, something passes through them. A Wavelenght.

A SIGNAL.
|A DISTRESS signal. I've told them to listen for that.

Half a galaxy away, I get the CALL...
|And the next instant -- as fast as a THOUGHT -- My mind has left MY body and tuned into THEIRS.

Time is not a factor. Not for ME.
|My name is EDWARD CHARLES ALLAN BROCK	and I'm the KING IN BLACK.

The king of all SYMBIOTES.

I move them here -- I put them there.

They go as I say, they do as I tell them.

Call me EDDIE.

Everybody does.

Hey, folks, nice night.
|Eddie. Eddie!

HAIL, eddie...

Hello, Eddie.
|Looks like a classic SPACE PIRATE attack. They take out the propulsion, board her, execute the CREW -- Then fly the CARGO POD back to base.

That looks like a RELIEF FREIGHTER too, probably carrting MEDICINES or FOOD...

Okay priority ONE -- We go in, save anyone we can.

Priority TWO is teach these creeps a LESSON.
|A lot of planets still NEED that kind of help after what KNULL did to the galaxy.

The PREVIOUS king, god of the VOID -- A lord of darkness from before the universe began.

If you see any BAD GUYS, think of me, I'll hop in your head and do the VIOLENT part.

Is that cool?
|But he's DEAD. He's NEVER COMING BACK.

I'M the king now. EDDIE THE FIRST.

And as long as I'M around -- As long as I'm in CHARGE of the symbiotes...

Yes, Eddie.

Yes, Eddie.
|Nobody EVER needs to fear them AGAIN.

YESSS.
|EDDIE.
|Talk to the people you love, Eddie Brock.
|Tell them to run. Tell the to hide.
| 
|Your son. Your other. It won't make a difference.
|There is no escape for any of you.
| 
|Mr. Elephant's night train isn't doing the trick?

Nope. Read it TWICE even...
|I told you we shouldn't have her NAP so late in the day...

... Dani's NOWHERE close to going to bed.

Well, hopefully I can BORE her to sleep with STORIES of my night of NOTHINGS when I get back.
|Looks like JOEY is still in his OFFICE burning the midnight oil instead of home DEAD ASLEEP.

Don't you mean just "DEAD"?
|JESS... SIX private detectives murdered in a WEEK?

I know you've got POWERS, but still --

Luke, I can take care of MYSELF...
|... Speaking of wich, I'm gonna let you go, honey.

I'll call you if i die, promise.

NOT funny, J -- *TAK*
|Huh.

Don't like the looks of this...
|Dammit...

G-grr... ff...
|Joey!

Gkk... J-Jessie... zat you...?
|#$@%! Joey! Hold on, man! I'm calling for --

's him, Jessie...

Shouldn't... shouldn't've taken th-the... gigs...
|... F-FISK is cleaning' h-house...

C-careful, Jessie... He's...
|I never ruled through power.
|I ruled through fear.
|I'd give them peeks at the animal. The smell of him.

Do they understand my restraint? How hard it's been to keep that animal caged?
|That my life has been about that cage?

Do they know that the devil's torn the doors off?
|Nobody has ever seen me before.

Seen Wison Fisk.

Gazed at the blinding sun of my fury.
|Do you see what you've done, Daredevil?

Do you see that my hands are yours now too?
|You've killed them all.
|And you don't even know it yet.
